Dear All,

Please see the attached .pdf for your final project's formal description. Also let me know as soon as possible (the latest: Next week's lecture), if you are going to work as a group. (Max 2 people, I will not allow last minute "squeezing into" someone's project)

The deadline is strictly observed. December 13th, (I have a deadline too, to grade all your projects and to submit your grades to the system)

Feel free to send me an e-mail if you have any further questions.

Good Luck

Ahmet C. Yuksel
